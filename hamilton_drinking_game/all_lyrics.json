    "description_preview": "The cast recording to the hit Broadway musical, Hamilton, written by Lin-Manuel Miranda blends musical theater, hip-hop, rap, R&B, jazz, pop, and American history to dramatize the life of founding father Alexander Hamilton, based on the biography by Ron Chernow. Despite depicting historical figures, the show practices colorblind (more like purposefully colorful) casting. As countless promotional materials state, Hamilton aims to depict \u201cAmerica then, as told by America now.\u201d\n\nThis record was the first album to ever receive a 5 star review on billboard.com and it went on to win the Grammy in 2016 for best musical theater album. The Broadway production won 11 Tonys, including Best Musical, and the book won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama.\n\nIn an interview with American Theater, Miranda said:\n\nThere\u2019s lots of [Easter eggs] in Hamilton. I don\u2019t want to give them away, because I feel like Rap Genius is going to have a field day finding them.\n\nMiranda has also tweeted his approval of the annotations:\n\n\n\nThe Hamilton production team embedded the Genius-annotated lyrics on their official website. The New York Observer even posted a news story about the annotation project.\n\n\n\nWant to help out with annotating this album? Come join us:\n\n\nThe project page lists the project\u2019s supervising editors and overall goals.\nThe forum thread is for hashing out annotations with other users, or general conversation about the album.\nThe Hamilton Apocrypha album contains extras, cut songs, and meta posts related to the show as a whole.",

New York City\n\n[HAMILTON]\nPardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?\n[BURR]\nThat depends. Who's asking?\n\n[HAMILTON]\nOh, well, sure, sir\nI'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir\nI have been looking for you\n\n[BURR]\nI'm getting nervous\n\n[HAMILTON]\nSir\u2026\nI heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?\n[BURR]\nYou punched the bursar\n\n[HAMILTON]\nYes!\nI wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid\n\n\nSo how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?\n\n[BURR]\nIt was my parents' dying wish before they passed\n\n[HAMILTON]\nYou're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan\nGod, I wish there was a war!\nThen we could prove that we're worth more\nThan anyone bargained for\u2026\n\n[BURR]\nCan I buy you a drink?\n\n[HAMILTON]\nThat would be nice\n\n[BURR]\nWhile we're talking, let me offer you some free advice\nTalk less\n[HAMILTON]\nWhat?\n\n[BURR]\nSmile more\n\n\n[HAMILTON]\nHa\n[BURR]\nDon't let them know what you're against or what you're for\n\n[HAMILTON]\nYou can't be serious\n\n[BURR]\nYou wanna get ahead?\n\n[HAMILTON]\nYes\n\n[BURR]\nFools who run their mouths off wind up dead\n\n[LAURENS]\nYo yo yo yo yo!\nWhat time is it?\n\n[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]\nShow time!\n\n[BURR]\nLike I said\u2026\n\n\n[LAURENS]\nShow time! Show time! Yo!\nI'm John Laurens in the place to be!\nTwo pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!\nThose redcoats don't want it with me!\nCuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!\n[LAFAYETTE]\nOui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!\nThe Lancelot of the revolutionary set!\nI came from afar just to say \u201cBonsoir!\u201d\nTell the King \u201cCasse toi!\u201d Who's the best?\nC'est moi!\n[MULLIGAN]\nBrrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan\nUp in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said \u201cCome again?\u201d\n[LAFAYETTE & LAURENS]\nAyyyyy\n\n[MULLIGAN]\nLock up ya daughters and horses, of course\nIt's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets\u2026\n\n[LAFAYETTE]\nWow\n\n[LAURENS]\nNo more sex, pour me another brew, son!\nLet's raise a couple more\u2026\n\n[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]\nTo the revolution!\n\n[LAURENS]\nWell, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!\n\n[MULLIGAN]\nAaron Burr!\n\n[LAURENS]\nGive us a verse, drop some knowledge!\n\n[BURR]\nGood luck with that: you're takin' a stand\nYou spit. I'm \u2018a sit. We'll see where we land\n[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]\nBoooo!\n\n[LAURENS]\nBurr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?\n\n[HAMILTON]\nIf you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?\n\n[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]\nOoh\nWho you?\nWho you?\nWho are you?\n\n[MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE/LAURENS]\nOoh, who is this kid? What's he gonna do?"

There\u2019s a million things I haven\u2019t done but\nJust you wait, just you wait\u2026\n\n[ANGELICA]\nSo so so\u2014\nSo this is what it feels like to match wits\nWith someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It\u2019s\nThe feeling of freedom, of seein\u2019 the light\nIt\u2019s Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?\nThe conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes\nEv\u2019rything we said in total agreement, it\u2019s\nA dream and it\u2019s a bit of a dance\nA bit of a posture, it\u2019s a bit of a stance. He\u2019s a\nBit of a flirt, but I\u2019m \u2018a give it a chance\nI asked about his fam\u2019ly, did you see his answer?\nHis hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?\nHe\u2019s penniless, he\u2019s flying by the seat of his pants\nHandsome, boy, does he know it!\nPeach fuzz, and he can\u2019t even grow it!\nI wanna take him far away from this place\nThen I turn and see my sister\u2019s face and she is\u2026\n\n[ELIZA]\nHelpless\u2026\n\n[ANGELICA]\nAnd I know she is\u2026\n\n[ELIZA]\nHelpless\u2026\n\n[ANGELICA]\nAnd her eyes are just\u2026\n\n[ELIZA]\nHelpless\u2026\n\n[ANGELICA]\nAnd I realize\n\n[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]\nThree fundamental truths at the exact same time\u2026\n[HAMILTON]\nWhere are you taking me?\n\n[ANGELICA]\nI\u2019m about to change your life\n\n[HAMILTON]\nThen by all means, lead the way\n\n[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]\nNumber one!\n\n[ANGELICA]\nI\u2019m a girl in a world in which\nMy only job is to marry rich\nMy father has no sons so I\u2019m the one\nWho has to social climb for one\nSo I\u2019m the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in\nNew York City is insidious\nAnd Alexander is penniless\nHa! That doesn\u2019t mean I want him any less\n\n[ELIZA]\nElizabeth Schuyler.

We've had quite a run\n[LAFAYETTE]\nImmigrants:\n\n[HAMILTON & LAFAYETTE]\nWe get the job done\n\n[HAMILTON]\nSo what happens if we win?\n\n[LAFAYETTE]\nI go back to France\nI bring freedom to my people if I'm given the chance\n[HAMILTON]\nWe'll be with you when you do\n\n[LAFAYETTE]\nGo lead your men\n\n[HAMILTON]\nSee you on the other side\n\n[LAFAYETTE]\n'Til we meet again, let's go!\n\n[ENSEMBLE]\nI am not throwin' away my shot!\nI am not throwin' away my shot!\nHey yo, I'm just like my country, I'm young\nScrappy and hungry\nAnd I'm not throwin' away my shot!\nI am not throwin' away my shot!\n[HAMILTON]\n'Til the world turns upside down\u2026\n\n[ENSEMBLE]\n'Til the world turns upside down!\n\n\n[HAMILTON]\nI imagine death so much it feels more like a memory\nThis is where it gets me: on my feet\nThe enemy ahead of me\nIf this is the end of me, at least I have a friend with me\nWeapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me\nThen I remember my Eliza's expecting me...\nNot only that, my Eliza's expecting\nWe gotta go, gotta get the job done\nGotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son!\nTake the bullets out your gun!\n\n[ENSEMBLE]\nWhat?\n\n[HAMILTON]\nThe bullets out your gun!\n\n[ENSEMBLE]\nWhat?\n\n[HAMILTON]\nWe move under cover and we move as one\nThrough the night, we have one shot to live another day\nWe cannot let a stray gunshot give us away\nWe will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it\nIt's either that or meet the business end of a bayonet\nThe code word is \"Rochambeau,\" dig me?\n\n\n[ENSEMBLE]\nRochambeau!\n\n[HAMILTON]\nYou have your orders now, go, man, go!\nAnd so the American experiment begins\nWith my friends all scattered to the winds\nLaurens is in South Carolina, redefining brav'ry\n\n[HAMILTON & LAURENS]\nWe'll never be free until we end slavery!\n\n[HAMILTON]\nWhen we finally drive the British away\nLafayette is there waiting\u2014\n\n[HAMILTON & LAFAYETTE]\nIn Chesapeake Bay!\n\n[HAMILTON]\nHow did we know that this plan would work?\nWe had a spy on the inside. That's right\n\n[HAMILTON & COMPANY]\nHercules Mulligan!\n\n[MULLIGAN]\nA tailor spyin' on the British government!\nI take their measurements, information and then I smuggle it\n\n[COMPANY]\nUp\n\n[MULLIGAN]\nTo my brother's revolutionary covenant\nI'm runnin' with the Sons of Liberty and I am lovin' it!\nSee, that's what happens when you up against the ruffians\nWe in the shit now, somebody gotta shovel it!\nHercules Mulligan, I need no introduction\nWhen you knock me down I get the fuck back up again!\n[COMPANY]\nLeft! Right! Hold!\nGo!\nWhat! What! What!\n[HAMILTON]\nAfter a week of fighting, a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet\n\n[LAFAYETTE]\nWe lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief\n\n[MULLIGAN]\nAnd just like that, it's over. We tend to our wounded, we count our dead\n[LAURENS]\nBlack and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nNot. Yet\n\n[HAMILTON]\nWe negotiate the terms of surrender\nI see George Washington smile\nWe escort their men out of Yorktown\nThey stagger home single file\nTens of thousands of people flood the streets\nThere are screams and church bells ringing\nAnd as our fallen foes retreat\nI hear the drinking song they're singing\u2026\n\n[ALL MEN]\nThe world turned upside down\n[COMPANY]\nThe world turned upside down\nThe world turned upside down\nThe world turned upside down\nDown\nDown, down, down\n\n[LAFAYETTE]\nFreedom for America, freedom for France!\n\n[COMPANY]\nDown, down, down\n\n[HAMILTON]\nGotta start a new nation\nGotta meet my son\n\n[COMPANY]\nDown, down, down\n\n[MULLIGAN]\nWe won!\n\n[LAFAYETTE]\nWe won!\n\n[MULLIGAN, LAFAYETTE & LAURENS]\nWe won!\n\n[MULLIGAN, LAFAYETTE, LAURENS, HAMILTON & WASHINGTON]\nWe won!\n\n[COMPANY]\nThe world turned upside down!"

Are you ready for a cabinet meeting???\nThe issue on the table: Secretary Hamilton\u2019s plan to assume state debt and establish a national bank. Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir\n\n[JEFFERSON]\n\u2018Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\u2019\nWe fought for these ideals; we shouldn\u2019t settle for less\nThese are wise words, enterprising men quote \u2018em\nDon\u2019t act surprised, you guys, cuz I wrote \u2018em\n\n[JEFFERSON/MADISON]\nOww\n\n[JEFFERSON]\nBut Hamilton forgets\nHis plan would have the government assume state\u2019s debts\nNow, place your bets as to who that benefits:\nThe very seat of government where Hamilton sits\n\n[HAMILTON]\nNot true!\n\n[JEFFERSON]\nOoh, if the shoe fits, wear it\nIf New York\u2019s in debt\u2014\nWhy should Virginia bear it? Uh! Our debts are paid, I\u2019m afraid\nDon\u2019t tax the South cuz we got it made in the shade\nIn Virginia, we plant seeds in the ground\nWe create. You just wanna move our money around\nThis financial plan is an outrageous demand\nAnd it\u2019s too many damn pages for any man to understand\nStand with me in the land of the free\nAnd pray to God we never see Hamilton\u2019s candidacy\nLook, when Britain taxed our tea, we got frisky\nImagine what gon\u2019 happen when you try to tax our whisky\n\n\n[WASHINGTON & CROWD]\nThank you, Secretary Jefferson\nThat's my alcohol!\nSecretary Hamilton, your response\n\n[HAMILTON]\nThomas. That was a real nice declaration\nWelcome to the present, we\u2019re running a real nation\nWould you like to join us, or stay mellow\nDoin\u2019 whatever the hell it is you do in Monticello?\nIf we assume the debts, the union gets\nA new line of credit, a financial diuretic\nHow do you not get it? If we\u2019re aggressive and competitive\nThe union gets a boost. You\u2019d rather give it a sedative?\nA civics lesson from a slaver. Hey neighbor\nYour debts are paid cuz you don\u2019t pay for labor\n\u201cWe plant seeds in the South. We create.\u201d\nYeah, keep ranting\nWe know who\u2019s really doing the planting\nAnd another thing, Mr. Age of Enlightenment\nDon\u2019t lecture me about the war, you didn\u2019t fight in it\nYou think I\u2019m frightened of you, man?\nWe almost died in the trench\nWhile you were off getting high with the French\nThomas Jefferson, always hesitant with the President\nReticent\u2014there isn\u2019t a plan he doesn\u2019t jettison\nMadison, you\u2019re mad as a hatter, son, take your medicine\nDamn, you\u2019re in worse shape than the national debt is in\nSittin\u2019 there useless as two shits\nHey, turn around, bend over, I\u2019ll show you\nWhere my shoe fits\n\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nExcuse me? Madison, Jefferson, take a walk! Hamilton, take a walk! We\u2019ll reconvene after a brief recess. Hamilton!\n\n[HAMILTON]\nSir!\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nA word\n\n[MADISON]\nYou don\u2019t have the votes\n\n[JEFFERSON/MADISON]\nYou don\u2019t have the votes\n\n[JEFFERSON]\nAha-ha-ha ha!\n\n[JEFFERSON/MADISON]\nYou\u2019re gonna need congressional approval and you don\u2019t have the votes\n\n[JEFFERSON]\nSuch a blunder sometimes it makes me wonder why I even bring the thunder\n\n[MADISON]\nWhy he even brings the thunder\u2026\n\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nYou wanna pull yourself together?\n\n[HAMILTON]\nI\u2019m sorry, these Virginians are birds of a feather\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nYoung man, I\u2019m from Virginia, so watch your mouth\n\n[HAMILTON]\nSo we let Congress get held hostage by the South?\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nYou need the votes\n\n[HAMILTON]\nNo, we need bold strokes. We need this plan\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nNo, you need to convince more folks\n\n[HAMILTON]\nJames Madison won\u2019t talk to me, that\u2019s a nonstarter\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nWinning was easy, young man. Governing\u2019s harder\n\n[HAMILTON]\nThey\u2019re being intransigent\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nYou have to find a compromise\n\n[HAMILTON]\nBut they don\u2019t have a plan, they just hate mine!\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nConvince them otherwise\n\n[HAMILTON]\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t get congressional approval?\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nI imagine they\u2019ll call for your removal\n\n[HAMILTON]\nSir\u2014\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nFigure it out, Alexander. That\u2019s an order from your commander"

I\u2019ll let him tell it\n[HAMILTON]\nI hadn\u2019t slept in a week\nI was weak, I was awake\nYou never seen a bastard orphan\nMore in need of a break\nLonging for Angelica\nMissing my wife\nThat\u2019s when Miss Maria Reynolds walked into my life, she said:\n\n[MARIA]\nI know you are a man of honor\nI\u2019m so sorry to bother you at home\nBut I don\u2019t know where to go, and I came here all alone\u2026\n\n[HAMILTON]\nShe said:\n\n[MARIA]\nMy husband\u2019s doin\u2019 me wrong\nBeatin\u2019 me, cheatin\u2019 me, mistreatin\u2019 me...\nSuddenly he\u2019s up and gone\nI don\u2019t have the means to go on\n\n\n[HAMILTON]\nSo I offered her a loan, I offered to walk her home, she said\n\n[MARIA]\nYou\u2019re too kind, sir\n\n[HAMILTON]\nI gave her thirty bucks that I had socked away\nShe lived a block away, she said:\n\n[MARIA]\nThis one\u2019s mine, sir\n\n[HAMILTON]\nThen I said, \u201cwell, I should head back home,\u201d\nShe turned red, she led me to her bed\nLet her legs spread and said:\n\n[MARIA]\nStay?\n[HAMILTON]\nHey\u2026\n\n[MARIA]\nHey\u2026\n\n\n[HAMILTON]\nThat\u2019s when I began to pray:\nLord, show me how to\nSay no to this\nI don\u2019t know how to\nSay no to this\n\nBut my God, she looks so helpless\nAnd her body\u2019s saying, \u201chell, yes\u201d\n\n[MARIA]\nWhoa...\n\n[HAMILTON]\nNooo, show me how to\n\n[HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE]\nSay no to this\n\n[HAMILTON]\nI don\u2019t know how to\n\n[HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE]\nSay no to this\n\n[HAMILTON]\nIn my mind, I\u2019m tryin\u2019 to go\n\n\n[ENSEMBLE]\nGo! Go! Go!\n\n[HAMILTON]\nThen her mouth is on mine, and I don\u2019t say\u2026\n[ENSEMBLE]\nNo! No!\nSay no to this!\nNo! No!\nSay no to this!\nNo! No!\nSay no to this!\nNo! No!\nSay no to this!\n[HAMILTON]\nI wish I could say that was the last time\nI said that last time. It became a pastime\nA month into this endeavor I received a letter\nFrom a Mr. James Reynolds, even better, it said:\n\n[JAMES]\nDear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health\nAnd in a prosperous enough position to put wealth\nIn the pockets of people like me: down on their luck\nYou see, that was my wife who you decided to\n\n[HAMILTON]\nFuuuu\u2014\n\n[JAMES]\nUh-oh! You made the wrong sucker a cuckold\nSo time to pay the piper for the pants you unbuckled\nAnd hey, you can keep seein\u2019 my whore wife\nIf the price is right: if not I\u2019m telling your wife\n\n[HAMILTON]\nI hid the letter and I raced to her place\nScreamed \u201cHow could you?!\u201d in her face\nShe said:\n\n[MARIA]\nNo, sir!\n\n[HAMILTON]\nHalf dressed, apologetic. A mess, she looked\nPathetic, she cried:\n\n[MARIA]\nPlease don\u2019t go, sir!\n\n[HAMILTON]\nSo was your whole story a setup?\n\n[MARIA]\nI don\u2019t know about any letter!\n\n[HAMILTON]\nStop crying\nGoddamnit, get up!\n\n[MARIA]\nI didn\u2019t know any better\n[HAMILTON]\nI am ruined...\n\n[MARIA & HAMILTON]\nPlease don\u2019t leave me with him helpless (I am helpless\u2014how could I do this?)\nJust give him what he wants and you can have me\nI don\u2019t want you\nWhatever you want (I don\u2019t want you)\n\n[MARIA, HAMILTON, & ENSEMBLE]\nIf you pay (I don\u2019t\u2026)\nYou can stay\nLord, show me how to\nSay no to this (Say no to this!)\nTonight (I don\u2019t know how to)\n(Say no to this!)\nSay no to this\n'Cause the situation\u2019s helpless (Helpless)\nAnd her body\u2019s screaming, \u201cHell, yes\u201d (Whoa!)\nHow can you (No, show me how to)\n(Say no to this!)\nSay no to this? (Say no to this)\n(Say no to this!)\nHow can I say no to this?\nThere is nowhere I can go (Go! Go! Go!)\nWhen her body\u2019s on mine I do not say\u2026 (No!)\n\n[HAMILTON, MARIA, & ENSEMBLE]\nYes (Yes!)\nSay no to this!\nNo!\nYes (Yes!)\nSay no to this!\nNo!\nYes (Yes!)\nSay no to this!\nNo!\nYes (Yes!)\nSay no to this!\nSay no to this\u2026\nI don\u2019t say no to this (Don\u2019t say no to this)\nThere is nowhere I can go\nGo go go...\n\n[JAMES]\nSo?\n\n[HAMILTON]\nNobody needs to know"

Secretary Hamilton, your response\n\n[HAMILTON]\nYou must be out of your Goddamn mind if you think\nThe President is gonna bring the nation to the brink\nOf meddling in the middle of a military mess\nA game of chess, where France is Queen and Kingless\nWe signed a treaty with a King whose head is now in a basket\nWould you like to take it out and ask it?\n\u201cShould we honor our treaty, King Louis\u2019 head?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026 do whatever you want, I\u2019m super dead.\u201d\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nEnough. Hamilton is right\n\n[JEFFERSON]\nMr. President\u2014\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nWe\u2019re too fragile to start another fight\n\n\n[JEFFERSON]\nBut sir, do we not fight for freedom?\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nSure, when the French figure out who\u2019s gonna lead \u2018em\n\n[JEFFERSON]\nThe people are leading\u2014\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nThe people are rioting\nThere\u2019s a difference. Frankly, it\u2019s a little disquieting you would let your ideals blind you to reality\nHamilton\n\n[HAMILTON]\nSir\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nDraft a statement of neutrality\n[JEFFERSON]\nDid you forget Lafayette?\n\n[HAMILTON]\nWhat?\n[JEFFERSON]\nHave you an ounce of regret?\nYou accumulate debt, you accumulate power\nYet in their hour of need, you forget\n\n[HAMILTON]\nLafayette\u2019s a smart man, he\u2019ll be fine\nAnd before he was your friend, he was mine\nIf we try to fight in every revolution in the world, we never stop\nWhere do we draw the line?\n[JEFFERSON]\nSo quick-witted\n\n[HAMILTON]\nAlas, I admit it\n\n[JEFFERSON]\nI bet you were quite a lawyer\n\n[HAMILTON]\nMy defendants got acquitted\n\n[JEFFERSON]\nYeah. Well, someone oughta remind you\n\n[HAMILTON]\nWhat?\n\n[JEFFERSON]\nYou\u2019re nothing without Washington behind you\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nHamilton!\n\n[JEFFERSON]\nDaddy\u2019s calling!"

Are you done?\n[MADISON]\nYou are uniquely situated by virtue of your position\n\n[JEFFERSON]\nThough virtue is not a word I'd apply to this situation\n\n[MADISON]\nTo seek financial gain, to stray from your sacred mission\n\n\n[JEFFERSON]\nAnd the evidence suggests you've engaged in speculation\n\n[BURR]\nAn immigrant embezzling our government funds\n\n[JEFFERSON/MADISON]\nI can almost see the headline, your career is done\n\n[BURR]\nI hope you saved some money for your daughter and sons\n\n[BURR/JEFFERSON/MADISON]\nYa best g'wan run back where ya come from\n\n[HAMILTON]\nHa!

How was the rest of your show?\n\n[GEORGE]\nI'd rather skip the pleasantries, let's go\nGrab your pistol\n\n[PHILIP]\nConfer with your men\nThe duel will commence after we count to ten\n\n[ENSEMBLE]\nCount to ten!\n\n[PHILIP]\nLook 'em in the eye, aim no higher\nSummon all the courage you require\nThen slowly and clearly aim your gun towards the sky\n\n[MALE ENSEMBLE]\nOne, two, three, four\n\n[FULL ENSEMBLE]\nFive, six, seven"

What is a legacy?\nIt\u2019s planting seeds in a garden you never get to see\nI wrote some notes at the beginning of a song someone will sing for me\nAmerica, you great unfinished symphony, you sent for me\nYou let me make a difference\nA place where even orphan immigrants\nCan leave their fingerprints and rise up\nI\u2019m running out of time. I\u2019m running, and my time\u2019s up\nWise up. Eyes up\nI catch a glimpse of the other side\nLaurens leads a soldiers\u2019 chorus on the other side\nMy son is on the other side\nHe\u2019s with my mother on the other side\nWashington is watching from the other side\nTeach me how to say goodbye\nRise up, rise up, rise up\nEliza\n\nMy love, take your time\nI\u2019ll see you on the other side\nRaise a glass to freedom...\n\n[BURR AND COMPANY]\nHe aims his pistol at the sky\u2014\n\n[BURR]\nWait!\n[BURR]\nI strike him right between his ribs\nI walk towards him, but I am ushered away\nThey row him back across the Hudson\nI get a drink\n\n[COMPANY]\nAaaah\nAaaah\nAaaah\n\n[BURR]\nI hear wailing in the streets\n\n[COMPANY]\nAaaah\nAaaah\nAaaah\n\n[BURR]\nSomebody tells me, \u201cYou\u2019d better hide.\u201d\n\n[COMPANY]\nAaaah\nAaaah\nAaaah\n\n[BURR]\nThey say\n\n[BURR AND ANGELICA]\nAngelica and Eliza\u2014\n[BURR]\nWere both at his side when he died\nDeath doesn\u2019t discriminate\nBetween the sinners and the saints\nIt takes and it takes and it takes\nHistory obliterates\nIn every picture it paints\nIt paints me and all my mistakes\nWhen Alexander aimed\nAt the sky\nHe may have been the first one to die\nBut I\u2019m the one who paid for it\n\nI survived, but I paid for it\nNow I\u2019m the villain in your history\nI was too young and blind to see...\nI should\u2019ve known\nI should\u2019ve known\nThe world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me\nThe world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me"
